This is a reusable app to build mixtapes for django. 
I wrote this app in 5 hours, and now that it works I will be working to make it as portable as possible. After
it's a "reusable app", I will be adding lots of new features. I plan to have it production ready later tonight or tomorrow.

Features coming soon:
- ajax reordering of tracks
- banner color picker widget
- batch upload, with pretty progress bars
- ability to upload larger files over slow connections (goes along with batch upload)
- user permissions for creating/editing/deleting tapes/tracks

Gotchas:
- mediaplayer.swf and mango.js must reside on the same domain as your templates for cross-domain security reasons.
You can get the .swf to work from another domain using a properly configured crossdomain.xml, but the .js must
 come from the same domain and it's much easier to keep the .js and .swf together.

Known issues:
- clicking on anything other than the tape name will not take you to the tape.
- clicking on the track name will play the first track, not the one you clicked on.
